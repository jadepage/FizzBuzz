# FIZZ BUZZ
When it counts you Fizz Buzz. 
A javascript coding exercise using loops.
A program that prints the numbers from 1 tom 100 and 
for multiples of '3' displays 'Fizz' instead of the number and
for mutiples of '5' displays 'Buzz instead of the number.
If a multiple of both then displays 'FizzBuzz'.
